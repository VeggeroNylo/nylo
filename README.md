## What's Nylo?

**Nylo** is a new programming language ideated by [@veggero](https://github.com/veggero) and [@AmerigoGuadagno](https://github.com/AmerigoGuadagno), and developed by all the [@pyTeens](https://github.com/pyTeens) team.
Its __performance__ and its __syntax__ are so awesome that you'll reconsider sex.

```
fib:
    with int n
    if (=0 or =1)
      1
    else
      fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
## How Nylo will help me?

**Nylo** has got a lot of **libraries** that can do **everything** and it also supports __Python modules!__ Isn't that so awesome?
It's going to change how we code, that's it.
